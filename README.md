  ## Description
  When creating this project, I set out to create an employee tracker to help various companies keep track of their teams, job titles, and departments, more easily. By completing this assignment, I learned how to use mySQL and create tables in a terminal.

  ## Installation
  Clone this repository into your local machine,  open up the intregrated terminal by right clicking on the "db" folder, then do the following command:

  ```mysql -u root -p```

  After you type in your password, you will want to source your files using the following commands:

  ```source schema.sql```

  ```source seeds.sql```

  Finally, you will want to right click on server.js and open a new integrated terminal. From here, just type this command:

  ```npm i```
  
  ## Usage
  To use this project, use your server.js integrated terminal, and type in the following command:
  
  ```npm start```

 After that, select whichever option you like, and follow the prompts!

 Here is a helpful video to demonstrate the process:
